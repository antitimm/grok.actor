# grok.actor

A random character generator for the GROK?! tabletop RPG.

See the live page at [https://antitimm.github.io/grok.actor/](https://antitimm.github.io/grok.actor/)

## Project Status

This is very much a work in progress.  Expect things to shift without notice.  I don't really know what I'm doing, so this is me failing in public.

## Thanks

Thanks to Lester Burton for [GROK?!](https://lestortoise.itch.io/grok), it's a great little game.

Thanks to [Karl Druid](https://linktr.ee/makedatanotlore) for Scvmbirther and Ramanan Sivaranjan for [Save vs Total Party Kill](https://save.vs.totalpartykill.ca/). Both were hugely inspirational in figuring out random generators.
